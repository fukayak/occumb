#' Fish eDNA metabarcoding dataset
#'
#' A dataset of fish eDNA metabarcoding collected in the Kasumigaura watershed, Japan.
#'
#' @format A list containing an array of sequence read count, \code{y},
#'  a vector of the total number of mismatched bases in the priming region of
#'  the forward and reverse primers for each species, \code{mismatch},
#'  and a factor indicating whether the riverbank at each site lacked aquatic
#'  and riparian vegetation, \code{riverbank}.
#'  Sequence reads were obtained from three replicates (collected from the
#'  center of the river and near the left and right riverbanks)
#'  from 50 sites across the watershed, of which read counts from six samples were
#'  missing.
#'  The resulting sequence counts of 50 freshwater fish taxa detected were
#'  recorded.
