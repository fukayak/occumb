Fitting null model (.e., intercept-model, although value intercept species-specific) simple, follows: model fitting can take approximately one hour. Given occumb() fits class complex hierarchical models many parameters unknown variables, may require, depending dataset size, long time /lot memory model fitting. Setting parallel = TRUE recommended faster model fitting parallel computations. model incorporating species site covariates fish dataset can fitted follows: , riverbank specified covariate site occupancy probability (psi) formula_psi argument, mismatch covariate relative dominance sequence (phi) formula_phi_shared argument. latter, since mismatch species covariate, formula_phi_shared argument used instead formula_phi effect mismatch constant across species; see vignette(\"model_specification\") details.
