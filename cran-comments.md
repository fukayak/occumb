# occumb (version 1.0.1)

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Added a reference describing the methods in the package to the Description field of the `DESCRIPTION` file.

- Added the Value field to `.Rd` files regarding exported methods (i.e., `plot` and `summary`).

- Removed `\dontrun` in cases where the execution time of example codes was < 5 sec and otherwise replaced `\dontrun` with `\donttest`. Also, fixed bugs in the example codes found during this process.

- local: Linux Mint 20.1 R 4.3.1

- mac-builder (release)

WARNING
‘qpdf’ is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs

This warning appears locally but not in win-builder and mac-builder. Hopefully it does not matter when compiled on CRAN.

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Package suggested but not available for checking: ‘spelling’

This is likely a temporary issue because version 2.2.1 of spelling package is available in CRAN.
